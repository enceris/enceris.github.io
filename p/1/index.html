<p><em>Clad with the blood of either friend or foe, the original shine
of the blade could barely be recognized. Gone are the days of prosperity
and kinship, for the era upon him was grim and full of carnage and evil.
The man once sought truth followed the trail of deceit, and he now finds
himself at a loss of who to call his ally. There was no land that held
its rightful ruler, yet all of mankind seemed to agree to a mutual
bloodshed and malice. Wrath was the only common denominator on this
continent, yet he spoke boldly to catch the attention of the beast
before him. "The lands, they must be cleansed. These people, they must
be saved." Such drivel should be ignored by the strong, for the words of
the weak were meant to be trampled. Yet the man challenged the Heralds
of Death with his words alone: "The strong does not yet exist as it once
had. Order will find itself as the mighty returns." These Heralds, who
have abused kinship to conjure fear, found trepidation in the man that
spoke these words. They exhausted all of their forces to claim his head
but to no avail. "Thy speak of the strong not existing, the strong be
returning, you dare not refer to thyself?" spoke the head of Regulus, to
which the man replied, "To compare the strong to the likes of you and I,
we are helpless at its mercy. The worth of your head, and the worth of
mine, we are but dust in his eyes. Your provocations would not even
appear in the cognizance of the strong." Despite his admonishments, the
man was hunted to the point of self-exile, for there was no land that
did not desire his blood splattered across the floors. This man yearned
not for the strong, yet could not help but express his bitterness, for
the weak have gathered together to expedite another's decay. Yet in his
eyes, he too was of the weak, and it was his duty to see to it that the
strong would one day return. "Demiurgos meets Invictus, Life meets
Death," thus spoke the man.</em></p>
<p>Sitting in his lonesome, he recalled his favorite excerpt from an old
tale, <em>The Man at Peak's End.</em> At both an unknown time and
setting, this tale depicts a prodigy that was denounced by his country
and his people for his bold prophecies. To prevent his loved ones from
being slain, the man fled and vanished into obscurity; what remains now
is a mysterious story with no definitive end. Although this tale is
greatly shadowed by the likes of <em>The Four Heroes</em> and <em>The
Peerless Warlord</em>, he found this specific tale much more intriguing
and charming. <em>Perhaps it was the lack of details and
popularity,</em> he thought to himself, <em>that the work had a sense of
credibility that would have been left untouched since its writing. No
exaggeration, and nothing inserted for the purpose of entertainment; a
raw piece of history depicting a time in which this flourishing world
housed the most incredulous of prosecutors. The less infamy a work has,
the more merit it boasts</em>, he concludes. After all, the work has no
other versions, meaning its words have never been tampered from its
original creation. While it remains a mystery with many questions left
unanswered, he felt a connection with this story. It shined a bright
light on many importances of his life.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's right." He spoke out, before looking around the training
room in search of people. He sensed a presence entering, but it wasn't
one to be wary of. A memory resurfaced in his mind, and he dropped the
eighty kilogram weight that he was lifting with his left arm. Standing
up, he reached into his pocket to pull out a small notebook as he walked
over to one of the training dummies. Then, he proceeded to open the
notebook and begin writing as he spoke out:</p>
<p>"This world follows seven core principles, and you will learn more
about them and their origins when you grow older. They are named after
the individuals who were the subject of worship. These are very
important to understand, so listen to me carefully as I tell you these
codes.</p>
<p>The Code of Avita: One in power cannot be forcefully dethroned, it is
the decision for the masses to decide who to follow.</p>
<p>The Code of Yggdrasil: One is not allowed to deprive another of their
merriment.</p>
<p>The Code of Krotek: One may be enslaved only without
mistreatment.</p>
<p>The Code of Imperion: One can prevent a war or stop it, for war does
not have to see its end.</p>
<p>The Code of Fleur: One's chastity, marriage, and love is destined by
oneself. False love, arranged marriages, and the deprivation of one's
virginity is taboo.</p>
<p>The Code of Sohee: One can be indicted, but cannot be punished
without integrity.</p>
<p>The Code of Ignis: One will not find salvation in taking one's own
life.</p>
<p>If these kinds of things interest you, I can provide you with <em>The
Seven Vows,</em> which contains everything there is about these codes
and the individuals. There's also history, but... before learning about
history, it's important to know about the now. This is the Luminous
continent, home to the Three Kingdoms: Ingram, the nation of scholars
and wisdom. Located further north at the east coast of the continent,
the ruler of the nation is also the headmaster of their famous academy.
Many important discoveries have been made there, and I have nothing but
respect for them. At the center of the nation is the Armament, one of
the most secure research facilities. Bordering Ingram to the south west
is Scyte, a nation of battle known as the 'land of the mercenaries.'
Ruled by one man and his generals, Scyte is mostly known for its
military might and their fearsome God Generals. These individuals have
the potential to be the strongest in the land. Lastly, bordering Scyte
as well as the east coast of this continent is Azura, the nation of
prosperity and honor. This is where we are, a beautiful empire ruled
over by two noble houses. Everybody in our nation is at peace, and we
have not seen conflict in centuries. Within the continent, as well as
other continents, is a hub for the Imperial Order; you may come to know
this faction as simply the 'Guild.' Here, in Azura, is where this
embassy resides.</p>
<p>About the Imperial continent, it is one of the most historic and rich
continents. This continent houses the Regal Kingdoms, which controls the
Guild and was once ruled by one of the Seven: Imperion. The continent is
also where Allanon, the great Elven woods, reside. Just east of it is
Adneil, the imperial Elven nation. Another one of the Seven, Fleur, was
a revered figure in this country."</p>
<p>"Walter, are you speaking to yourself?" Before he could continue,
Walter was interrupted by a man who had been at the entrance for some
time. "Am I interrupting?"</p>
<p>"As always, you have no presence. I could only sense your entering,
but afterwards it was nearly impossible to follow, Master Darus."</p>
<p>"That was an awfully long speech, I'd love to ask its purpose but I'm
afraid I don't have the leisure to do so."</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"Cassius has ordered me to inform you, all of the Aesir from across
the continent have been called to gather at the Cathedral Hall. Although
you are still young and in training, he specified that you must attend
as well."</p>
<p>He walked away from the dummy and reached over to a table, placing
his notebook down. "This sounds rather important. Are there any other
details?"</p>
<p>Darus shook his head, looking downwards. Walter always picks up on
small gestures such as these.</p>
<p>"I can only inform you of the orders. However, I can inform you on
what to expect. After all, the Aesir that will be there are not all from
Azura..."</p>
<p>Darus continued to debrief, but unbeknownst to him he had begun
explaining to a sturdy wall. Although Walter had utmost respect for him,
hearing his voice reminds him of the authorities in the continent. Born
to nobility, yet never participating in it, Walter was born to be a
warrior and has been separated from the families at a young age,
training in solemn alone-ness.</p>
<p><em>I was taken in by Lord Luminous, who gave me 'The Man at Peaks
End.' I recall the words as clear as ever from the tale... 'You four,
you shall carry my burden; no, my hopeless dreams. You endure hardship,
pain, struggle and suffering not because you are weak. No, this
experience accumulates because it is destined for the strong to never
yield to such barbarism. Let it stack over and over, for I truly believe
such mundane tasks do not even render in your eyes. You four, your
greatness and strength is guaranteed. I shall see to it, even when my
bearings have transcended this world, that you will become that which
I... which they have... no, that which YOU have envisioned yourself. The
weak must not decide for the strong, and the strong must find a role to
assume to present to the weak. These ramblings of mine, I pray you four
shall cherish it dearly for eons to come; for when the strong remember
me so, I shall be the reminder to them of you who serve as the
origin.'</em></p>
<p>"Walter..."</p>
<p>A young man, standing tall with his hands over an open notebook. He
looked downwards in self-absorbed focus. <em>This was the sight of a man
deep in thinking and mourning</em>, Darus thought to himself.</p>
<p>"Very well then." Walter utters, closing the notebook as he
approaches Darus. "I will go."</p>
<p>"How long has it been since you last left this place?"</p>
<p>"Seven months, eight days, fifteen hours."</p>
<p><em>Precise, exact. This man was separated from his family at a young
age to cultivate what he is now, how monstrous.</em></p>
<p>As Walter walked past Darus, a sense of absolute conviction emitted
from the young boy. Darus was used to these kinds of auras, but seldom
did he feel it from somebody still in their youth. Walter had just
recently turned eighteen, but he already has the abilities of a
long-time warrior.</p>
<p>Closing the door, Walter pointed at the only decoration hung up. "Did
you notice? My sword's sheath is on the door that you walked through.
But the sword itself, I always leave it elsewhere."</p>
<p>"You've learned since that incident, I can see that."</p>
<p>Silence followed. He brought the sheathe down and equipped it to his
waist. "I won't be treated that way a second time." He then walked to
the training dummies, where he removed its head and lifted a stainless
broadsword from within the body.</p>
<p>"It still perplexes me, Walter." Darus took a seat by the dummy near
him. "This sword that I gave you, it was unbelievably light when I last
picked it up. Such a thin blade, it's terrifying how much impact you are
able to give it with each swing."</p>
<p>"You noticed this is the same blade?"</p>
<p>"Though it's untouched, I can see that you polish it with care. I can
always get you a new, higher quality one."</p>
<p>"There's no need for that."</p>
<p>"I don't mean to underestimate your abilities as an Anima, but having
a better weapon never hurts." <em>After all, the quality of the blade
hasn't decreased since I gave it to you. Has it gotten even better,
actually?</em></p>
<p>Walter sheathed his sword and tidied up his boots.</p>
<p>"At some point, you'll come to a revelation that not any sword can
work for you. Imperion himself had his own specific equipment, soon you
will be the same. It's a warrior's specialty."</p>
<p><em>Although his interpretation of warrior spirit and understanding
of warrior culture is completely accurate... I am sure he would find it
difficult to believe the properties of the sword,</em> Walter thought to
himself. In this world, there is a universal force that exists within
every being: Psyche. A person's psyche is determined at birth, and
psyche is measured in terms of affinity. Each race has different
affinities, but there are only four of them. For humans like Walter,
they wield the affinities of four elements: Fire, Water, Earth, or Wind.
The title of Anima is given to those that have the highest affinity for
their respective element, a traditional practice of the Luminous
continent. <em>I am the Anima of Earth, and my sword is... a completely
normal broadsword that can be purchased anywhere at any local smithery.
I know that much. The abilities that Anima are capable of, the ones that
I had spent so much time learning, makes us several magnitudes stronger
than the common folk. My ability to turn weak material into powerful
ones, that is what I specialize in. So... I am sorry, but I won't be in
need of a signature weapon. Not any time soon.</em></p>
<p>"Let's go, the carriage is waiting for us."</p>
<p>"Understood."'</p>
<p>Walter's gaze was fixed, and his resolve was hardened. He suddenly
became more aware of the events that awaited him, as his eyes flared in
fervor.</p>
<p>"And before we get on, I'd like to remind you of something."</p>
<p>Darus paused for a brief moment, then continued walking forward. He
could sense the burning aura behind him, but that aura almost diminished
entirely after he halted.</p>
<p>Walter analyzed the man in front of him. <em>His back stiffened, and
his shoulders rose just slightly. His chest is out more, and his walking
became more rhythmic. He spoke these words with an ominously casual
tone. I had rationalized that there must be a reason for this. Perhaps
his own consciousness, or maybe he is being watched?</em></p>
<p>"Fear kills warriors that don't mend it to their will. Walter du
Aesir..."</p>
<p>Before Walter could return to his state of ardent preparation, Darus
exerted a dominating and suffocating aura. It was as if the man that was
just in front of him was now towering over him, and he was merely an
insect that his shadow mistook for the ground.</p>
<p>"You haven't felt that fear as much as you need to."</p>
<p>The aura dissipated, as they both carried on. <em>Perhaps, this will
prevent him from making mistakes due to his eagerness. I don't mean to
scare you more than life already has, my student. This is for your own
good.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Cathedral Hall was a place in which only a single aspect of it
warranted an accurate name. Although there is a cathedral-like entrance
and a tower at the center, the area itself had no halls nor did it
resemble a cathedral. It was a wide circular building, encased within a
dome of protection. The area around this hall was known as "Babylon's
Hell," because it prevents normal people from being able to reach the
center due to its harsh conditions. The entire area itself serves as
both training grounds and a containment zone. A large leyline vein
passes through this area, and to the west of it is what's known as a
leyline deposit. Leyline veins are currents that run through this world
that carry energy, which can be converted into psyche. To prevent
leyline deposits from being too rich in psyche, the Vanir family makes
breaches into large leyline veins across the country. Specters, beings
created from the energy that passes, spawn from these veins. These
entities are harmful and considered monsters. They take a multitude of
forms and slay indiscriminately. As warriors of Azura, we must learn the
many different archetypes of specters as well as the range at which
their strength may vary. But of course, traversing Babylon's Hell and
reaching Cathedral Hall should not pose any life-threatening difficulty
to an Aesir.</p>
<p>The Aesir have absolute loyalty to the Vanir despite being a more
powerful family. The Aesir have much larger numbers, as well as the most
skilled fighters of the continent, while the Vanir represent one of the
two houses that rule Azura, the House of Tilith. The other house,
represented by Aidan Baine, is the House of Lyra. Walter, being
exceptionally loyal to the Vanir, cared very little for the House of
Lyra.</p>
<p>Darus leaned forward in the carriage to grab Walter's attention, who
was spacing out. "While we are here, do you mind if I ask what your talk
was about?"</p>
<p>"Are you referring to back at the training hall?"</p>
<p>"I am. It was a little unnerving to hear you speak in such a soft
tone. It felt unusual, but humorous at the same time."</p>
<p>"Lord Charles Vanir will be having a new child soon, and I have been
appointed to this child by Lord Luminous himself. I was practicing my
teaching methods."</p>
<p>"I see. When do you expect to have that talk with the child?"</p>
<p>With a stern face, he uttered, "After they are born."</p>
<p>Darus burst out in laughter, and even the carriage driver couldn't
help but chuckle. "You know, kid, you never fail to amuse me."</p>
<p>"I was serious, it would be best for them to learn this as soon as
possible."</p>
<p>"You're not much of a teacher, are you?"</p>
<p>"I'm merely imitating you."</p>
<p>"That's a different case, Walter. You were a genius, it was easy to
teach you everything at once. But not everyone's as gifted as you,
you'll have to wait and see what that child is capable of. I know I'm
not much of a teacher, but I know that much at least."</p>
<p>"Your teachings have influenced me greatly, mind you. I believe
you've done splendidly. In your honor, I will make sure the child grows
up well."</p>
<p>Darus scratched his head and looked beyond the horizon. "Not
listening to me, are you? You took away all the difficulty of teaching,
you should observe someone else. Pick up a pupil or two later on,
perhaps the struggle will shape you into a good instructor."</p>
<p>"A pupil... would that be appropriate for me?"</p>
<p>"Let go of the past, Walter. You're not some trainee anymore. I've
seen what you can do, you're already a full fledged warrior. But you're
still not ready, Walter du Aesir. You still need the experience."</p>
<p><em>Experience? This came about suddenly. Perhaps this event at
Cathedral Hall... this is an experience necessary for me. Lord Cassius
wants me there, but all of the Aesir have gathered. The meaning of
this...</em></p>
<p>"I know that very well. Thank you, Master Darus."</p>
<p>"That being said, don't overload the child with all that damn
information! Make it thorough, what's the kid gonna do after learning
such an important code from a single sentence, huh?!"</p>
<p>"That's... a very good point." He took his notebook out and began
writing. Once more, he was fully engrossed and had become that sturdy
wall. "How might I make this optimal for their survivability?" He
mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>Darus laughed again, "Survivability, eh? I guess you can't argue with
that!"</p>
<p>"Master?"</p>
<p>He brought his hand closer to Walter's head, then extended his index
finger. "Whatever's in here, it's enough to make a rough man like me
chuckle. That's how I'm sure you'll be a good mentor."</p>
<p><em>He continued onward, seeming content with my responses. I will
admit, after thinking about what I said I am rather embarrassed. It's
rather silly after considering that I am talking about a child... but he
doesn't seem to realize that this is the child of Lord Charles, the most
powerful man in Azura. There's no doubt their potential will supersede
us both.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Arriving at Cathedral Hall was a surreal feeling to Walter. He had
never been around so many people before, let alone his own kindred. At
the center of the hall was Lord Cassius, the director of the Aesir
legion, and the general of the Azuran Imperial Guard. On his left stood
three individuals: Theros, the captain of the first imperial brigade;
Arthur, captain of the fourth; Lord Michael, the first God General of
Scyte. Michael's presence alone escalated the significance of today's
events. To the right of Cassius: Babel, captain of the second and Kevin,
captain of the third. Darus left Walter's side and walked up the steps,
positioning himself to the rightmost. <em>Lord Michael and Lord Cassius,
and all of the brigade captains. Master Darus, as well. Just what is in
store for us?</em></p>
<p>Just then, the murmur of the crowd was interrupted by Cassius. "Five
hundred and twelve heads on this continent claim the title of Aesir.
Only four hundred and eighty-three of you are present. At least eight of
you have died on the way here, and the rest could not make it. The
latter two groups, of course, are no longer Aesir."</p>
<p>Only a few voices continued in the crowd. A majority remained silent
and composed. Walter was perplexed that some could not make it to
Cathedral Hall, even more at the fact that some had died. A few chuckles
within the crowd struck a nerve within Walter, a taunt for the fallen.
<em>Not every Aesir is the same as I</em>, he thought to himself.
<em>Master Darus could not have been more accurate. The crowd is
confused, worried, eager, and speculatory. No such meeting has ever
taken place on a scale this grand, so why now?</em></p>
<p>"Silence!" Darus' voice roared out, as the captains began walking
down the steps. Darus followed shortly after, and the crowd made way for
them. One by one, they left the hall. Whether the silence was out of
fear or respect, it continued long after the captains were out of
sight.</p>
<p>"Those of you that know of what will transpire today, remain
standing. The rest of you, please be seated or kneel." It was as if
Cassius' voice casted a spell of obedience, as hundreds of Aesir were
brought to their knees. <em>Nearly everyone, including myself, kneeled
to the ground and looked up in scrutiny. There were about twelve or
fourteen people remaining standing. From their composure, I could see
the dread and fear that flooded their being. What exactly is going
on?</em></p>
<p>"Very well then." A soft whirring could be heard, but no one dared to
pinpoint its location. Then, in an instant---<em>BANG!</em> The men that
were standing fell to their ground, their headless bodies clashing with
those who kneeled. Those that remained did not dare leave their current
positions. <em>The heads of the deceased were all pierced with a spear
connected to a rope, with a force great enough to completely remove it
from the body. Just what would happen had they have missed?</em> "Search
their bodies for identification. Find me their drill instructor. We
shall have them executed. Let this be an ultimatum to all of you, when
you have your own disciples and underlings: whatever occurs today,
should you ever become a superior... you will speak not of this."</p>
<p><em>Dead silence. Fear. The sound of death. The aura of control. All
of these are present around me right now. Royal agents rummaged through
the corpses, and as the agents left, Cassius ordered us all to stand.
Many trembled, very few maintained their composure. They were hesitant
to stand, but even more hesitant to disobey. I was the fourth person to
stand, even if the first bunch did in an instant.</em></p>
<p>"Each of you will return to Babylon's Hell. We have serrated the vein
that flows below us to its limit. You have a few tasks, but you need
only complete one: take the head of twenty specters; bring the heads of
at least ten of your own kind; defeat one of the captains in a fight
after finding them, they will not kill you but I doubt you would be able
to kill them if you tried. Lastly, if you wish, you may challenge me
right here. However, if I deem you unworthy, I will take your life."
Several robed individuals entered the hall, making their way to the
center.</p>
<p><em>In just a few moments, everything had changed. The minds of us,
the Aesir, could not comprehend what had just happened that quickly. I
could see people tremble, and a few try their best to remain composed.
Their bodies begin to precipitate, and it accumulates by their
fingertips and the edge of their head. Their gaze becomes fixated, but
occasionally relaxes. I wonder, just what kind of reaction would my body
be having from another perspective? Lord Cassius... I respect this man
greatly. Even as he prepares to send me to my possible death, I look up
to him in reverence. Am I smiling? I can feel the tension on my face,
but... I don't think my mind has caught up yet. This trial, can it be a
trial? A death sentence? A chance to reveal my capabilities, to show
everyone what I am capable of? Is this... really the right time to feel
such profuse thrill?</em></p>
<p>One of the figures removed their robe. It was Morgaine Ballard, a
noble of the Vanir family. "There will be a grace period of three hours.
All spectral beasts have been neutralized, but will be free to move once
this period ends. No killing or fighting shall take place in these three
hours. Use this time to your advantage, please remain here if you wish
to challenge Cassius." Her voice was cold and unforgiving.</p>
<p>A familiar figure made her way from behind Cassius. After removing
her hood, the crowd began to kneel.</p>
<p>"L-Lady Alice!"</p>
<p>"Her Majesty!"</p>
<p>She motioned her arm outward, urging the warriors to lift their
heads. "I am sure my presence here is a surprise for you. But this isn't
a matter that concerns only the people of Azura. This is why Lord
Michael is here as well."</p>
<p>The man himself stepped forward. A few of the warriors fell back from
their kneeling. Just one footstep, a shockwave of his power was enough
to frighten beasts.</p>
<p>"Queen Alice li Vanir will make the closing remarks." Another hood
went down, it was Hyland Baine, a high ranking member of the House of
Lyra.</p>
<p>The queen stepped forward, looking from the left to the right. "I
have high hopes for all of you. Although normally the head of that many
specters is enough, I believe that the head of an Aesir alone would be
worth a hundred specters... you get me? This trial is not only a
measurement of passage, but keep in mind the importance of glory and
honor."</p>
<p><em>So this is a trial to their eyes. Her tone, it's oddly casual. Is
she unaware of what had just happened to a few of us? No, that can't be.
Glory and honor... It's as if she spoke to fan the flames of treachery
as well. High hopes for all of us, but it seems the easiest route would
be to turn on one another, especially after valuing each of us at that
level of praise. This... reminds me of 'The Man at Peak's End', this
sense of ambiguity that I feel. The possibility of not being able to
determine who is an ally, only being able to confirm foes through
battle. This thrill... it's as if these circumstances were ordained by
fate.</em></p>
<p><em>TIME TO BATTLE: 2:57:04</em></p>
<p><em>People left in groups, or on their own. It seemed that nobody
wanted to stay to challenge Cassius... I definitely didn't, either.
Cassius is renowned for his terrifying abilities. Lord Cassius went
toe-to-toe with Lord Michael of Scyte before, a man strong enough to
cleave mountains. I'd imagine he would cut everyone down in one hit,
claiming that those unable to survive one attack aren't worthy to live.
Luckily for us, Babylon's Hell was a large forested area, with different
unique zones. The forest becomes notably denser further west, and there
is a large lake south east. Up in the north is a plains area with a lot
less trees. Directly east has a gorge that separates this area and the
border of Lyra, one of the graceful cities of Azura. The river coming
from the lake pours out as a waterfall into this gorge. From the looks
of it, many sought out others to form teams, while others began laying
traps---Alice's words have pushed many of us to think of murder, it
seems.</em></p>
<p><em>For an Aesir, we don standard gear for soldiers. The difference
between us and a regular soldier is our tacit uniqueness in battle; we
all have our own different methods of fighting. A few of us are armed
with various secondary weapons, some of us carry shields, some prefer
cloaks over gear. With my abilities, taking ten heads would be more than
easy for me... but something about Alice's words irks me. Perhaps it's
an option, but not the right one. I'm sure many of us believe this is
the easiest route, but seeing as Cassius did not give much care to any
individual's life... it's just another test?</em></p>
<p><em>TIME TO BATTLE: 2:18:22</em></p>
<p><em>I have situated myself atop one of the trees. This location
grants me a good view of the plains and the lake, as well as enough
security to be safe from a ranged attack. I have been pondering whether
or not I should spill the blood of my brethren. Glory and honor, they
have been stated but not defined... what would they mean in the eyes of
the common man? We are warriors, and we think different from those we
protect. Is it really honorable to take from others, to steal an
opportunity, a life? This trial seems too straightforward. The risk of
challenging what seems to be the clear answer is high as well. I need to
clearly assess what I know. After scouting about, it seems that the
specters are much more dangerous than made out to be. All of the
specters I have encountered have been cavalry class, but I have spotted
a few brigade class threats as well. I even came across two warlord
class threats. Right, I should probably think about how to explain
monsters to the child...</em></p>
<p>"Monsters, including specters, follow the threat system created by
the Imperial Order, commonly referred to as the guild. The rankings of
the system were originally used to determine what kind of manpower was
needed to subdue the threat, but it has since been changed after the
guild became an independent party. Wanted individuals are also listed on
this scale, which is as follows:</p>
<p>Rogue Class, adversaries that likely need only one skilled individual
to subdue them. This class is commonly used to label everyday felons,
and is rarely used to describe monsters or specters.</p>
<p>Cadre Class, adversaries that require multiple people to subdue. For
more powerful felons, and a few monsters, this is the threat level you
would expect.</p>
<p>Battalion Class, which requires a uniform and orderly group to
subdue, with a large emphasis on orderly. Synergy is almost a
requirement to subdue such threats.</p>
<p>Cavalry Class, threats that require powerful arms or equipment to
defeat. Most monsters that have tough defenses will be of this class or
higher, and the felons of this threat are more likely to be named
criminals.</p>
<p>Brigade Class, threats that would need a large army to subdue. These
are the monsters that threaten to wipe out communities, and are often
being searched by the guild to defeat quickly.</p>
<p>Warlord Class, these beings require people like Master Darus, or even
Lord Cassius to subdue. Uniting trained warriors would likely be
ineffective, so the guild enlists special operators to handle these
threats.</p>
<p>Emperor Class, where the decision to combat these threats must be
discussed with the leaders of the area they reside in. Threats like
these... it's unsurprising that they might end up creating war.</p>
<p>Judgement Class, entities that require immediate suppression and many
figures to subdue. For people that reach this threat level and above,
they are the world's most wanted and are held in one of the most heavily
guarded containment facilities. I... know one of these individuals.</p>
<p>Apocalypse Class, which is realistically the highest class. The name
speaks for itself, but these beings are nothing short of terrifying. The
Heralds of Death from <em>The Man at Peak's End</em> would likely all be
in this tier.</p>
<p>And lastly... Demise Class. There has only been one entity of this
class, who started an entire era. You may have heard of them from the
story <em>The Four Heroes,</em> Alfa Lucius. This one individual
destroyed an entire portion of the Imperial continent, breaking it a
part and resulting in The Ruined Lands. Ah, I have been lost in thought
for too long, it seems that twenty minutes have passed."</p>
<p><em>There were exactly two warlord class threats, only two. This kind
of trial really is starting to feel like a death sentence, but not just
yet for me. And there's still the matter with what Lady Alice said
regarding our prerequisites, it makes this trial seem a lot more...
suspicious. A hundred specters being valued less than the heads of ten
Aesir seems so unbelievable now that I see what beasts they have for us.
I must be onto something... just what is honor and glory?</em></p>
<p><em>Groups seem to form no more than four. The amount of trust in one
another has weakened thanks to Lady Alice's words, but it surprises me
that there is still enough to form teams... but perhaps it's merely a
setup? Camaraderie, betrayal, how do these play into honor and glory?
There are many death traps all around, things are getting intense very
quickly. Am I the only one still pondering the meaning of this all? Was
I meant to get drunk on fear or thrill?</em></p>
<p>A man walked past the tree Walter had situated himself in,
overhearing his demo. <em>I guess a group this large would have its fair
share of strange individuals,</em> he thought to himself before carrying
on.</p>
<p><em>TIME TO BATTLE: 1:04:37</em></p>
<p><em>There really are only cavalry class specters or higher here, and
to make matters worse... a few of us have gone to challenge Cassius.
Perhaps they believed the courage to face such a man was the answer, but
I could sense their presence vanish one after another. After scouting
around, I found the locations of each of the captains. At first, I knew
Kevin was further west, deep in the forest, and Darus was out in the
open in the plains. I then encountered Babel, who was by the river
south-east, it seems that he refuses to take on groups and is planning
for one-on-one situations. The same cannot be said for Theros, who took
the high grounds. Theros specializes in ranged combat, if I were to
challenge one of the captains it would definitely not be him. After
returning to my original position, I've found that the captains will not
leave their positions; would they not give chase, either? Though, if
honor was considered, perhaps it wouldn't be right to run from the
battle in the first place.</em></p>
<p><em>TIME TO BATTLE: 0:07:27</em></p>
<p><em>I noticed something, or rather, I came to a revelation after
remembering what happened at Cathedral Hall. Though their heads were
taken, Cassius required the identification even though their heads would
have been enough. It seems the captains are preparing for battle, I
should make do with the information I have. But first, I need to check
if I am prepared for this trial.</em></p>
<p><em>My primary sword, always sheathed. I won't be needing this, not
soon at least. I have twenty knives on my person, and two spare dirks. I
have six antidotes in case I get poisoned, and two quality fabrics to
stop any lethal wound from bleeding. My chainmail has been strengthened
under this gear of mine, but just in case... I'll fortify this cloak so
it can act as a shield. With my abilities, each of these knives should
be enough to pierce through any armor. I have made my decision: the
"head" of an Aesir is worth more than a hundred specter, which is why we
must not cut down one another. Proof of victory is all that we need to
give.</em></p>
<p><em>If my internal clock is correct, the grace period should be
concluding soon.</em></p>
<p><em>In about...</em></p>
<p><em>3...</em></p>
<p><em>2...</em></p>
<p><em>1...</em></p>
<p><em>...</em></p>
<p>"The grace period has concluded." Lord Michael's voice thundered
through the silence.</p>
